# MLLogger

## Overview

The ML Logging Class is a Python library that simplifies the process of logging and tracking machine learning experiments. It helps data scientists and machine learning engineers keep a record of model training runs, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, and more. This README.md provides an overview of the ML Logging Class and how to use it effectively.

## Features

- Log machine learning experiments to a CSV or Excel file.
- Record key information including model type, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics.
- Support for custom evaluation metrics and interpretation of model fit.
- Easily integrate with popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the ML Logging Class, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install ml-logging-class
Basic Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the ML Logging Class:

python
Copy code
from ml_logging_class import MLLogger

# Initialize the logger
ml_logger = MLLogger()

# Fit a machine learning model and log the results
ml_logger.fit_and_log(model, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
Documentation
For detailed usage instructions and additional features, please refer to the Documentation.

Examples
We've provided several example notebooks in the Examples directory to demonstrate how to use the ML Logging Class in different machine learning scenarios.
